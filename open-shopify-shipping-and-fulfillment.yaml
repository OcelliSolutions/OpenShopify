For example, the [ fulfillment order move](/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentorder#post-fulfillment-orders-fulfillment-order-id-move) endpoint has been called, and you see the original fulfillment order in the `moved_fulfillment_order` field within the response. \r\n2.  Work on the fulfillment order has not yet begun, which means that the fulfillment order has the `open`, `scheduled`, or `on_hold` status, and the shop's location properties might be undergoing edits (for example, in the Shopify admin). \r\n\r\nIf the [ move](/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/fulfillmentorder#post-fulfillment-orders-fulfillment-order-id-move) operation has moved the fulfillment order's line items to a new location, but hasn't moved the fulfillment order instance itself, then the original fulfillment order's assigned location doesn't change. This happens if the fulfillment order is being split during the move, or if all line items can be moved to an existing fitting fulfillment order at a new location.\r\n\r\nOnce the fulfillment order has been taken into work or canceled, which means that the fulfillment order has the `in_progress`, `closed`, `cancelled`, or `incomplete` status, assigned location acts as a snapshot of the shop's location content. Up-to-date shop's location data may be queried through [ get location](https://shopify.dev/api/admin-rest/latest/resources/location#get-locations-location-id) endpoint with `assigned_location.location_id` supplied.\r\n\r\n*   **address1**: The street address of the assigned location. \r\n*   **address2**: An optional additional field for the street address of the assigned location. \r\n*   **city**: The city of the assigned location. \r\n*   **country_code**: The two-letter code for the country of the assigned location. \r\n*   **location_id**: The ID of the shop's location where the fulfillment is expected to happen.
